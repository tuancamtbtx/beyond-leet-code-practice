Live coding interviews are a common part of the technical interview process in many big tech companies. These interviews are designed to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills, coding ability, and understanding of algorithms and data structures. Here's a general overview of what you might expect and how to prepare for a live coding interview using Python:

### What to Expect

1. **Environment**: 
   - You might use a shared coding platform like CoderPad, HackerRank, or a company's proprietary tool.
   - Some interviews may be conducted over a video call with a shared screen.

2. **Types of Problems**:
   - Algorithm and data structure problems (e.g., arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs).
   - Real-world scenarios or system design questions.
   - Debugging existing code or optimizing inefficient solutions.

3. **Time Limit**:
   - Typically, each problem is expected to be solved in 20-45 minutes.

4. **Interaction**:
   - Interviewers may ask you to explain your thought process.
   - You might be asked to write tests for your code or consider edge cases.

### How to Prepare

1. **Strengthen Fundamentals**:
   - Review basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues).
   - Practice algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal).

2. **Practice Coding**:
   - Use platforms like LeetCode, CodeSignal, or HackerRank to practice problems.
   - Focus on writing clean, readable, and efficient code.

3. **Understand Python Specifics**:
   - Be familiar with Python's standard library and built-in functions.
   - Know how to use list comprehensions, lambda functions, and other Pythonic constructs.

4. **Mock Interviews**:
   - Conduct mock interviews with peers or use online services to simulate the interview environment.

5. **Problem-Solving Techniques**:
   - Break down problems into smaller parts.
   - Use a systematic approach: understand the problem, plan a solution, implement the solution, and test it.

6. **Communicate Effectively**:
   - Clearly explain your thought process and reasoning.
   - Ask clarifying questions if the problem statement is ambiguous.

7. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Consider edge cases and test your code against them.
   - Think about time and space complexity.

### Example Problem

Here's a simple example to illustrate a typical live coding problem and solution using Python:

**Problem**: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    # Normalize the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase
    normalized_str = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    # Check if the normalized string is equal to its reverse
    return normalized_str == normalized_str[::-1]

# Example usage
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("race a car"))  # Output: False
```

### Tips

- Stay calm and focused, even if you get stuck.
- Write code incrementally and test frequently.
- Don't hesitate to ask for hints or guidance if you're unsure about the problem requirements.

By preparing thoroughly and practicing regularly, you can improve your chances of performing well in live coding interviews at big tech companies.

# New 
Sure! Here are ten medium-level Python coding examples that cover a variety of topics, including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. These examples are designed to help you practice and improve your Python skills.

### Example 1: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s):
    char_index_map = {}
    max_length = 0
    start = 0

    for end, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in char_index_map and char_index_map[char] >= start:
            start = char_index_map[char] + 1
        char_index_map[char] = end
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(longest_unique_substring(s))  # Output: 3
```

### Example 2: Product of Array Except Self

```python
def product_except_self(nums):
    length = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * length

    left_product = 1
    for i in range(length):
        answer[i] = left_product
        left_product *= nums[i]

    right_product = 1
    for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= right_product
        right_product *= nums[i]

    return answer

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        if current[0] <= last[1]:
            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])
        else:
            merged.append(current)

    return merged

# Example usage
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
