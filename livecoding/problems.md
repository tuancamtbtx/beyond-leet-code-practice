Certainly! Here are a few example problems that you might encounter in a live coding interview using Python. Each problem is followed by a brief description of what it entails.

### Problem 1: Two Sum

**Description**:  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example**:
```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
```

### Problem 2: Valid Parentheses

**Description**:  
Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

**Example**:
```python
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: True
```

### Problem 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Description**:  
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`. Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example**:
```python
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

### Problem 4: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description**:  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example**:
```python
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Problem 5: Reverse a Linked List

**Description**:  
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example**:
```python
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Problem 6: Find the Missing Number

**Description**:  
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**Example**:
```python
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2
```

### Problem 7: Maximum Subarray

**Description**:  
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example**:
```python
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

These problems are designed to test different aspects of your coding skills, such as understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving. Preparing solutions for these types of problems will help you get ready for a live coding interview.
