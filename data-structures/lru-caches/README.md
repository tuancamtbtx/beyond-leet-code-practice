An LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache is a type of data structure that is designed to manage a limited amount of data by removing the least recently accessed items when it reaches its capacity. This eviction policy ensures that the most frequently accessed items remain in the cache, improving performance for access patterns with temporal locality.

### Key Concepts

1. **Cache Capacity**: The maximum number of items the cache can hold. When this limit is reached, the least recently used item is evicted to make space for new items.
2. **Eviction Policy**: The strategy used to determine which item to remove when the cache is full. In an LRU cache, the item that has not been accessed for the longest time is evicted.
3. **Temporal Locality**: The principle that recently accessed items are likely to be accessed again in the near future.

### Common Operations

1. **Get(Key)**: Retrieves the value associated with the given key from the cache. If the key is found, the item is moved to the front to mark it as recently used.
2. **Put(Key, Value)**: Inserts a key-value pair into the cache. If the cache is full, the least recently used item is evicted. The new item is added to the front to mark it as recently used.

### Data Structures Used

An LRU cache is typically implemented using a combination of a hash map (or dictionary) and a doubly linked list:

1. **Hash Map**: Provides O(1) time complexity for get and put operations by mapping keys to nodes in the doubly linked list.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Maintains the order of items based on their usage. The most recently used item is moved to the front, and the least recently used item is at the back.

### Implementation

Here is a simple implementation of an LRU cache in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}
        self.head = Node(0, 0)
        self.tail = Node(0, 0)
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def _remove(self, node):
        prev = node.prev
        next = node.next
        prev.next = next
        next.prev = prev

    def _add(self, node):
        prev = self.head
        next = self.head.next
        prev.next = node
        node.prev = prev
        node.next = next
        next.prev = node

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            node = self.cache[key]
            self._remove(node)
            self._add(node)
            return node.value
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self._remove(self.cache[key])
        node = Node(key, value)
        self._add(node)
        self.cache[key] = node
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            node_to_remove = self.tail.prev
            self._remove(node_to_remove)
            del self.cache[node_to_remove.key]

# Usage example
cache = LRUCache(2)

cache.put(1, 1)
cache.put(2, 2)
print(cache.get(1))    # returns 1
cache.put(3, 3)        # evicts key 2
print(cache.get(2))    # returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4)        # evicts key 1
print(cache.get(1))    # returns -1 (not found)
print(cache.get(3))    # returns 3
print(cache.get(4))    # returns 4
```

### Explanation

1. **Node Class**: Represents a node in the doubly linked list, containing a key-value pair and pointers to the previous and next nodes.
2. **LRUCache Class**: Implements the LRU cache with methods for adding and removing nodes from the doubly linked list, and for getting and putting items in the cache.
3. **_remove** and **_add** Methods: Helper methods to remove a node from and add a node to the doubly linked list, respectively.
4. **get Method**: Retrieves the value associated with a given key. If the key is found, the corresponding node is moved to the front of the list.
5. **put Method**: Inserts a key-value pair into the cache. If the key already exists, the old node is removed. If the cache is full, the least recently used node is removed.

### Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Provides O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations.
2. **Improved Performance**: Keeps frequently accessed items in the cache, improving access times for these items.

### Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**: Requires additional memory to store the hash map and the doubly linked list.
2. **Complexity**: The implementation is more complex than simpler caching strategies like FIFO (First In, First Out) or LIFO (Last In, First Out).

### Conclusion

An LRU cache is a highly efficient and effective way to manage a limited amount of data, ensuring that frequently accessed items remain readily available. By combining a hash map with a doubly linked list, it achieves constant time complexity for both get and put operations, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
