## Data Structures Implemented

### Array
A collection of elements identified by index. Provides fast access to elements.

### Linked List
A linear collection of elements where each node points to the next node. Includes:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### Stack
A collection following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Supports `push` and `pop` operations.

### Queue
A collection following the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Supports `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.

### Deque
A double-ended queue that allows insertion and deletion from both ends.

### Hash Table
A collection of key-value pairs with fast insertion, deletion, and lookup.

### Heap
A specialized tree-based structure satisfying the heap property. Includes min-heaps and max-heaps.

### Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children.

### Binary Search Tree
A binary tree with the property that left child nodes are less than the parent and right child nodes are greater.

### Balanced Trees
Self-balancing trees to ensure efficient operations.
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree

### Graph
A collection of nodes and edges. Includes:
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph

### Trie
A tree-like structure for storing a dynamic set of strings.

### Set
A collection of distinct elements supporting union, intersection, and difference operations.

### Priority Queue
A queue where each element has a priority. Higher priority elements are dequeued first.

### Bloom Filter
A space-efficient probabilistic structure for testing set membership.

### Skip List
A layered linked list for fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.
