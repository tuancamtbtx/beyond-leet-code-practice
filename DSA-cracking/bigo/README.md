# Big O Notation

## Definition
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and the performance of code.

## Common Notations
- O(1): Constant time complexity.
- O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity.
- O(n): Linear time complexity.
- O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity.
- O(2^n): Exponential time complexity.

## Best Practices
- Analyze algorithms to understand their efficiency in terms of time and space.
- Choose algorithms with lower time and space complexities to optimize code performance.
- Consider trade-offs between time and space complexities based on specific use cases.

## Example
```javascript
// An example of O(n) time complexity
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      return i; // Found at index i
    }
  }
  return -1; // Not found
}
```

This section provides an overview of Big O notation, common notations, best practices, and a simple example to illustrate its usage in code.
