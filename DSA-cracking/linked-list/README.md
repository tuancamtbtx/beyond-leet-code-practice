# Linked List

## Overview
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. It is a dynamic data structure that uses memory efficiently and allows for easy insertion and deletion of elements.

## Types of Linked List
### 1. Singly Linked List
In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence. It consists of a head node that serves as the entry point to the list.

### 2. Doubly Linked List
In a doubly linked list, each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous nodes. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions.

### 3. Circular Linked List
In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This can be useful in applications where the list needs to be traversed continuously.

## Operations
The common operations supported by linked lists include:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Concatenation

## Usage
Linked lists are used in various applications, including:
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Managing memory allocation
- Polynomial manipulation in algebraic terms
- Symbolic integration in calculus

## Example
```javascript
// Sample code demonstrating the creation of a singly linked list in JavaScript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class SinglyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  // Insertion, deletion, traversal methods, etc.
}
