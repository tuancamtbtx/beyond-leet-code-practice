Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 8

Solution:
Using a stack to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses is another approach, although it is more commonly used to validate parentheses strings. However, we can still use a stack-like mechanism to track the current state of the parentheses string during the generation process. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
def generateParenthesis(n):
    def backtrack(stack, s, left, right):
        if len(s) == 2 * n:
            result.append(s)
            return
        if left < n:
            stack.append('(')
            backtrack(stack, s + '(', left + 1, right)
            stack.pop()
        if right < left:
            stack.append(')')
            backtrack(stack, s + ')', left, right + 1)
            stack.pop()

    result = []
    backtrack([], '', 0, 0)
    return result

# Example usage:
n1 = 3
output1 = generateParenthesis(n1)
print("Output for n = 3:", output1)

n2 = 1
output2 = generateParenthesis(n2)
print("Output for n = 1:", output2)
```

### Explanation:
- The `generateParenthesis` function initializes an empty list `result` to store the valid combinations.
- The helper function `backtrack` uses a list `stack` to simulate the stack mechanism, although in this context it doesn't directly affect the logic since we're primarily using it to track the current state.
- `s` is the current string being formed, while `left` and `right` track the number of open and close parentheses used so far.
- If the length of `s` equals `2 * n`, a valid combination is found and added to `result`.
- If the number of open parentheses `left` is less than `n`, we can add an open parenthesis `'('` to `s`, push it to the stack, and recurse.
- If the number of close parentheses `right` is less than `left`, we can add a close parenthesis `')'` to `s`, push it to the stack, and recurse.
- After each recursive call, we pop the stack to backtrack, although the stack itself is not used for validation here but to illustrate the stack-like recursive process.

This implementation still uses backtracking but incorporates a stack-like list to mirror the recursive decision-making process of adding parentheses.
