Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic
 
substring
 in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.
# Solution 1:
To calculate the Big O notation for the given code, we need to analyze both the `longestPalindrome` method and the `isPalindrome` helper method.

### `longestPalindrome` Method

1. **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, which runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Inner Loop:** The inner loop iterates from the current position `i` to the end of the string, which means it can run up to `n - i` times for each `i`. In the worst case, the inner loop iterates approximately `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop.

3. **Palindrome Check:** Within the inner loop, the code checks if the substring from `i` to `j` is a palindrome by calling the `isPalindrome` method.

### `isPalindrome` Method

- The `isPalindrome` method checks if a substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The operation `s[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the substring, which takes O(m) time, where `m` is the length of the substring being checked.

### Overall Time Complexity

- In the worst case, the `isPalindrome` method is called for every pair `(i, j)` with `i <= j`. The total number of such pairs is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n(n + 1) / 2`. This simplifies to O(n^2) pairs.

- For each pair, the `isPalindrome` method is called, which takes O(m) time. In the worst case, `m` can be as large as `n` (when checking the entire string).

- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^3), because for each of the O(n^2) pairs, we perform an O(n) operation.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(1) for the main method, since it uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `result`.

- However, the `isPalindrome` method creates a reversed copy of the substring, which requires O(m) additional space, where `m` is the length of the substring being checked. In the worst case, this can be O(n).

- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n) due to the space required for the reversed substring.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^3)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

The O(n^3) time complexity arises from the nested loops and the O(n) palindrome check, while the O(n) space complexity is due to the space needed for reversing substrings.


# Solution 2:
Calculating the Big O notation for an algorithm involves analyzing its time and space complexity to understand how the algorithm's performance scales with the size of the input. Let's break down the Big O notation for the "Expand Around Center" approach to finding the longest palindromic substring.

### Time Complexity

1. **Outer Loop:** The algorithm iterates over each character in the string with a loop that runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we consider each character and each pair of consecutive characters as potential centers of a palindrome.

2. **Expand Around Center:** For each center, the algorithm expands outward to check for palindromes. In the worst case, this expansion can go all the way to the start and end of the string. Therefore, the expansion around each center takes O(n) time in the worst case.

3. **Combining Both Parts:** Since we perform the expansion for each of the `n` potential centers, the overall time complexity is O(n^2). This is because, for each of the `n` centers, we may perform up to `n` comparisons in the worst case.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space. We only use a few integer variables to track the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found, as well as variables within the helper function for expansion. There is no additional space required that scales with the input size.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

The O(n^2) time complexity arises from the nested nature of the loop (iterating over each character and expanding around it), while the O(1) space complexity indicates that the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. This makes the "Expand Around Center" approach efficient for moderate-sized strings, though it may become less efficient for very large strings due to the quadratic time complexity.
